# LinkedOn

University of Glasgow Web App Development 2 Group Project

# Overview 
The object of Linked On is to be a website that connects employers and employees together.
A user not logged in will be able to view the landing page and the about page so they can easily understand the purpose of the website when visiting. They will also be able to register and sign-in. To register there will be two distinct user groups: Job seekers and Job employers, and they can both view other profiles and job categories.  
Job seekers will be able to register themselves into a particular job category they are seeking and have a profile that describes their experience and qualifications.
Job employers will be able to browse different job categories to look for potential employees and post job listings.
